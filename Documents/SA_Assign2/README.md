# CVE Search API Data Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflow that fetches cybersecurity vulnerability data from the [CVE Search API](https://cve.circl.lu), processes it into a clean, structured format, and stores it inside **MongoDB** for further analysis.  

It’s designed for learning and academic purposes — showing how to call APIs, transform JSON data, and handle it using Python and Git best practices.
